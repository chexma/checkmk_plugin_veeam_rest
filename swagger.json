      "description": "Veeam Backup & Replication exposes its entities through an application programming interface (API) based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style. The REST API allows you to query information about Veeam Backup & Replication entities and perform operations with these entities using HTTP requests and standard [HTTP methods](SectionOverview#section/HTTP-Methods).\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API is defined and described in a single document that conforms to [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) 3.0. The Veeam Backup & Replication REST API is defined in the `swagger.json` file. You can find the file in the installation folder of Veeam Backup & Replication.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API relies on the client-server model. The client makes a request to the server; the server processes the request and returns a response. Requests can contain parameters in their path, query and header. POST and PUT requests can include a request body with resource payload. In response, the client receives a conventional [HTTP response code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml), HTTP response header and an optional response body schema that contains a result model.\n\nParameters, request bodies, and response bodies are defined inline or refer to schemas defined globally. Some schemas are polymorphic. It reduces the REST API document size and allows you to use the same operation for different types of resources. For example, you can use the same operation to retrieve Microsoft Windows and Linux servers.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API works over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.\n\n\n### REST API Reference Map\n\nFor visual representation of all operations available in Veeam Backup & Replication REST API, see the [Veeam Backup & Replication 13 REST API Reference Map](https://www.veeam.com/veeam_backup_13_rest_api_reference_map_ot.pdf).\n",

      "description": "The following topics will help you learn how to connect to the REST API and authorize your access, and how to control and sort the data that the REST API returns.\n\n\n# Resource URLs\n\nEach Veeam Backup & Replication REST API-exposed entity has a resource representing it. To get a resource representation, request its URL.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API requests use the following base URL format:\n\n```yml\nhttps://<hostname>:<port>/api/<version>\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n -  `<hostname>` is a public IPv4 address or DNS hostname of the machine where Veeam Backup & Replication is installed.\n -  `<port>` is the REST API port number set during Veeam Backup & Replication installation.\n\nThe default port number is `9419`.\n\n -  `<version>` is an API version.\n\nThe current major version is `v1`.\n\nTo get a collection of Veeam Backup & Replication REST API resources, request the base URL followed by a resource collection endpoint. For example:\n\n```yml\nhttps://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions\n```\n\nTo get a representation of an individual resource, specify a resource identifier after the resource collection endpoint. For example:\n\n```yml\nhttps://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions/c36824e9-0c3e-4892-8dff-44fd56968506\n```\n\nThe resource identifier is represented by the id property of the resource. For example:\n\n```yml\n[\n    {\n        ...\n        \"id\": \"c36824e9-0c3e-4892-8dff-44fd56968506\",\n        \"name\": \"Infrastructure\",\n        ...\n        ,\n    },\n    {\n        ...\n        \"id\": \"e170b7a4-0375-41b1-b066-d4be19d7b7ce\",\n        \"name\": \"Backup Job 1\",\n        ...\n    }\n]\n```\n\n\n# Versioning\n\nVeeam Backup & Replication REST API is backward-compatible. This means that, in general, client requests that use an earlier version or revision of the REST API are compatible with further REST API updates. You can find the current Veeam Backup & Replication REST API version and revision in the REST API specification. It is specified in the `version` field of the `info` object. For example:\n\n```yml\n\"version\": \"1.3-rev1\"\n```\n\n\n## REST API Revisions\n\nThe table below lists the REST API revisions, their support statuses, and the Veeam Backup & Replication build numbers when the REST API revisions were released.\n\nThe `Deprecated` support status is intermediate. Deprecated REST API revisions are expected to become unsupported. You can still use them but it is recommended that you switch to a newer one.\n\n\n| REST API Revision | Support Status | Veeam Backup & Replication Build |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [1.3-rev1](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.3-rev1/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 13.0.1.180 |\n| [1.3-rev0](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.3-rev0/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 13.0.0.4967 |\n| [1.2-rev1](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.2-rev1/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 12.3.1.1139 |\n| [1.2-rev0](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.2-rev0/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 12.3.0.310 |\n| [1.1-rev2](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.1-rev2/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 12.2.0.334 |\n| [1.1-rev1](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.1-rev1/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 12.1.0.2131 |\n| [1.1-rev0](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/1.1-rev0/tag/SectionAbout) | Supported | 12.0.0.1420 |\n| [1.0-rev2](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/archive/backup/110/vbr_rest/reference/vbr-rest-v1-rev2.html) | Deprecated | 11.0.1.1261 |\n| [1.0-rev1](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/archive/backup/110/vbr_rest/reference/vbr-rest.html) | Deprecated | 11.0.0.837 |\n\n## Working with REST API Revisions\n\nYou must specify the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API version and revision in each request. The requirement lets you minimize changes in your client application with every REST API update.\n\nVeeam Backup & Replication REST API implements a combined approach of versioning:\n\n -  Major version is specified in the request path in the following format: `v<major_version>`. The current major version is `v1`.\n\n -  Version and revision are specified in the request header in the following format: `<version>-<revision>`. For example, `1.3-rev1`.\n\nFor example, to obtain current date and time on the backup server, send the HTTP GET request to the `api/<major_version>/serverTime` path. In the `x-api-version` header, specify a version and revision in the following format: `<version>-<revision>`.\n\n```yml\nRequest\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/serverTime\n\nRequest Header\nx-api-version:1.3-rev1\n```\n\n\n# Authorization and Security\n\nCommunication between the client and Veeam Backup & Replication REST API is established over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported. The client verifies the REST API identity with a server TLS certificate. For details on managing certificates, see [TLS Certificate](SectionOverview#section/Authorization-and-Security/TLS-Certificate).\n\n\n### Authorization in REST API\n\nAuthorization process of the REST API is based on the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and involves obtaining an access token and a refresh token.\n\n -  *Access token* is a string that represents authorization issued to the client. It must be specified in all requests during the current logon session.\n -  *Refresh token* is a string that represents authorization granted to the client. It is used to obtain a new access token if the current access token expires or becomes lost.\n\nThe authorization process involves the following procedures:\n\n1. [Requesting authorization](SectionOverview#section/Authorization-and-Security/Requesting-Authorization)\n2. [Using the refresh token](SectionOverview#section/Authorization-and-Security/Using-Refresh-Token)\n3. [Performing logout](SectionOverview#section/Authorization-and-Security/Performing-Logout)\n\n\n### Credentials Lifetime\n\nThe access token, refresh token and authorization code have their default lifetime after which they expire. The lifetime starts from the time the authorization response was generated.\n\n| Credential | Lifetime |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Access token** | 60 minutes |\n| **Refresh token** | 14 days |\n\n\n## Requesting Authorization\n\nTo get access to the REST API resources, the client obtains an access token — a string that denotes client access attributes and that must be specified in all requests to the REST API.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API accepts password grant type authorization, which allows you to get an access token by providing a user name and password.  \n\n### Example\n\nTo get an access token and a refresh token send the HTTP POST request to the `/api/oauth2/token` path. In the `x-api-version` header, specify the current revision of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API.  \nIn the request body, specify the following parameters:  \n| Parameter | Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `grant_type` | `password` | Authorization grant type |\n| `username` | `<Username>` | Account name used to access the backup server |\n| `password` | `<Password>` | Account password |\n\n```yml\nRequest\nPOST https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/oauth2/token\n\nRequest Header\nx-api-version:1.3-rev1\n\nRequest Body\ngrant_type=password&username=administrator&password=Password1\n```\n\nA successfully completed operation returns the *200* response code. In the response body, Veeam Backup & Replication returns an access token, its expiration time (in seconds) and a refresh token. Specify the access token in headers of further requests to the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API. The refresh token must be saved locally.\n\n```yml\nResponse\n200\n\nResponse Body\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6IjQ2MDU0QjExNTE3Njk0QzAxN0IyRTE2MTQyNURCRDM1QkNGNzY3NkQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJuYmYiOjE1ODY...\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6IjQ2MDU0QjExNTE3Njk0QzAxN0IyRTE2MTQyNURCRDM1QkNGNzY3NkQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJ0b2tlbl9pZCI...\",\n  \"expires_in\": 900,\n  \".issued\": \"2025-06-10T10:29:39\",\n  \".expires\": \"2025-06-10T10:44:39\",\n  \"username\": \"administrator\"\n}\n```\n\n## Using Refresh Token\n\nRefresh token is a token used to refresh an expired or lost access token.\n\nTo refresh an access token, send the HTTP POST request to the `/api/oauth2/token` path. In the request body, specify the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `grant_type` | `refresh_token` | Authorization grant type |\n| `refresh_token` | `<Refresh token>` | Previously saved refresh token |\n\nA successfully completed operation returns the *200* response code and a new pair of tokens in the response body.\n\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>TIP</strong><br>\n \nIf you have lost a refresh token, you can log in again under the same user account and get a new pair of tokens.</div>\n\n\n### Example\n\nTo refresh an access token, send the HTTP POST request to the `api/oauth2/token` path. In the `x-api-version` header, specify the current revision of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API.\n\nIn the body of the request, specify the `refresh_token` grant type and the refresh token itself.\n\n```yml\nRequest\nPOST https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/oauth2/token\n\nRequest Header\nx-api-version:1.3-rev1\n\nRequest Body\ngrant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6IjQ2MDU0QjExNTE3Njk0QzAxN0IyRTE2MTQyNURCRDM1QkNGNzY3NkQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJ0b2tlbl9pZCI6ImQ5ZDhiN2RlLWIwYjUtNDc1Yi04ZTE4LTU4ZGMzMzVmOWIzNSIsInNob3J0X3Rl...\n```\n\nYou receive a response in the following format.\n\n```yml\nResponse\n200\n\nResponse Body\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6IjQ2MDU0QjExNTE3Njk0QzAxN0IyRTE2MTQyNURCRDM1QkNGNzY3NkQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJuYmYiOjE1ODYyNTU3ODMsImV4cCI6MTU4NjI1NjY4MywiaWF0IjoxNTg2MjU1NzgzLCJhdWQiO...\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6IjQ2MDU0QjExNTE3Njk0QzAxN0IyRTE2MTQyNURCRDM1QkNGNzY3NkQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJ0b2tlbl9pZCI6ImI5MjJhNGJiLTJmY2YtNGMwZi1hZGMxLTg2M2I4YzY1MzkxMiIsInNob3J0X3...\",\n  \"expires_in\": 900,\n  \".issued\": \"2025-04-07T10:36:23\",\n  \".expires\": \"2025-04-07T10:51:23\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## Performing Logout\n\nTo log out, send the HTTP POST request to the `api/oauth2/logout` path. After you log out, access and refresh tokens are expired. A successfully completed operation returns the *200* response code.\n\n\n### Example\n\nTo log out, send the HTTP POST request to the `api/oauth2/logout` path. In the `x-api-version` header, specify the current revision of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API, in the `Authorization` header — currently valid access token in the `Bearer <access_token>` format.\n\n```yml\nRequest\nPOST https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/oauth2/logout\n\nRequest Header\nx-api-version:1.3-rev1\nAuthorization: Bearer YSEoaL6H9EEyJpnrJ9WhLtzbrrBBYWqMQFDBQuLnp13qGQX6MjNfZ_wriPIRHQrbY-8dYtsWcRZQczIHVuSqbnVb00m-yOihPZZHQ48aP1VcgUtgnYTvtAO3WRJ1cJ8VaIXzsV...\n```\n\nYou receive a response in the following format.\n\n```yml\nResponse\n200\n```\n\n\n## TLS Certificate\n\nCommunication between the client and Veeam Backup & Replication REST API is established over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported. The client verifies the REST API identity with a server TLS certificate. The REST API uses the certificate of Veeam Backup & Replication.\n\nDuring the Veeam Backup & Replication installation, a self-signed TLS certificate is created and bound to the REST API and the 9419 port.\n\nIf the existing TLS certificate expires, or if you want to use another certificate (for example, the one obtained from a Certificate Authority), you can add a new certificate. For details, see [Updating TLS Certificate](#updating-tls-certificate).\n\nTo view the TLS certificate, use the [Get Backup Server Certificate](Service#operation/GetServerCertificate) request.\n\n\n### Updating TLS Certificate\n\nIf the existing TLS certificate expires, you need to install a new one using the Veeam Backup & Replication console or Veeam PowerShell. For details, see the [Backup Server Certificate](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/backup_server_certificate.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide and the [Add-VBRBackupServerCertificate](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/powershell/add-vbrbackupservercertificate.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam PowerShell Reference.\n\n\n# HTTP Methods\n\nTo perform REST API operations, use the following standard HTTP methods:\n\n| Method | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `GET` | Retrieves information about a resource or collection | [Get All Jobs](Jobs#operation/GetAllJobs) |\n| `POST` | Creates a new resource in a collection or activates a resource action. | [Create Job](Jobs#operation/CreateJob) |\n| `PUT` | Makes changes to a resource | [Edit Job](Jobs#operation/UpdateJob) |\n| `DELETE` | Removes a resource from a collection. | [Delete Job](Jobs#operation/DeleteJob) |\n\n\n# Request and Response Headers\n\nHTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with HTTP requests or responses. An HTTP header consists of a case-insensitive name and header value. The colon `:` separates the name and the value of the header.\n\n\n## Request Headers\n\nWhen you send HTTP requests to the REST API, specify the following header parameters. All headers are required except the `Content-Type` header, which is required only if you specify a request body.\n\n| Header | Sample Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Authorization` | `Bearer eyJhbGciOi...` | Authenticates the client that sends the request to the server. The header must contain an access token in the following format: `Bearer <access token>`. |\n| `x-api-version` | `1.3-rev1` | Specifies the version and revision of the REST API. |\n| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Identifies the media type of the request body. The REST API supports the following media types:<ul><li>`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` — for the [Get Access Token](Login#operation/CreateToken) request.</li><li>`application/json` — for all other requests that contain a request body.</li></ul> |\n| `Accept` | `application/json` | Specifies the media type of the response body. The REST API supports only the `application/json` media type. |\n\n\n## Response Headers\n\nIn response, the server passes the following header parameters.\n\n| Header | Sample Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Cache-Control` | private | Specifies the private caching type (tied to the client) for requests and responses. |\n| `Content-Length` | 20256 | Identifies the length of the response body, in bytes. |\n| `Content-Type` | application/json; charset=utf-8 | Identifies the media type and encoding of the response body. The REST API supports only the `application/json` media type. |\n| `X-Frame-Options` | SAMEORIGIN | Blocks clickjacking attacks. |\n| `X-XSS-Protection` | 1; mode=block | Prevents reflected cross-site scripting attacks. |\n| `Strict-Transport-Security` | max-age=31536000 | Identifies that the server should only be accessed over HTTPS and specifies the time, in seconds, that the client should remember this requirement. |\n| `X-Content-Type-Options` | nosniff | Blocks media type sniffing. |\n| `Date` | Thu, 13 Apr 2025 14:35:46 GMT | The date and time the response was sent. |\n\n\n# Query Parameters\n\nQuery parameters help you control the amount and order of data that the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API returns for a resource or collection. Query parameters are part of the URL that you specify in the request. The question mark `?` separates query parameters from a resource collection path.\n\n<div class=\"important\"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br>\n \nAll query parameters are case-sensitive.</div>\n\nYou can use the following query parameters:\n\n -  [skip](SectionOverview#section/Query-Parameters/skip)\n -  [limit](SectionOverview#section/Query-Parameters/limit)\n -  [Sort Parameters](SectionOverview#section/Query-Parameters/Sort-Parameters)\n -  [Filter Parameters](SectionOverview#section/Query-Parameters/Filter-Parameters)\n\n\n## skip\n\nYou can use the `skip` query parameter to exclude the first N collection items from a response body.\n\nFor example, to return a list of sessions starting from the third one in the `/sessions` collection, send the following request:\n\n```sh\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions?skip=2\n```\n\nYou can combine the [limit](SectionOverview#section/Query-Parameters/limit-Parameter) and the `skip` query parameters to request a particular set of items. Note that the `skip` parameter is applied before the `limit` parameter, regardless of the parameter position in the request. That is, top results are selected from a collection where a set of items is already excluded.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API returns resources in the default order based on its own semantics. To sort or filter a collection before excluding results, use sort and filter parameters. Note that sort and filter parameters are applied before the `skip` parameter, regardless of their position in the request. That is, a collection is first filtered or sorted, and then the top results are excluded.\n\n\n## limit\n\nYou can use the `limit` query parameter to specify the maximum number of items of a resource collection to return in a response.\n\nFor example, to return only the first 3 sessions, send the following request:\n\n```sh\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions?limit=3\n```\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API returns resources in the default order based on its own semantics. To sort or filter a collection before excluding results, use sort and filter parameters. Note that sort and filter parameters are applied before the `limit` parameter, regardless of their position in the request. That is, a collection is first filtered or sorted, and then the top results are selected.\n\n\n## Sort Parameters\n\nYou can use the `orderColumn` and `orderAsc` query parameters to sort items of a resource collection in a response.\n\nSome resource properties of Veeam Backup & Replication REST API schemas can be used as parameter values for the `orderColumn` query parameter.\n\nIf the value of the `orderAsc` parameter is true, items are sorted in the ascending order by the `orderColumn` parameter. If the value is *false*, the items are sorted in the descending order.\n\nFor example, to sort sessions by session type in the ascending order, send the following request:\n\n```sh\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions?orderColumn=SessionType&orderAsc=true\n```\n\n\n## Filter Parameters\n\nYou can use filter query parameters to filter items of a resource collection to return a subset of resources in a response. The subset includes only those resources that satisfy parameter value specified in the query.\n\n\n### nameFilter\n\nThe `nameFilter` query parameter is used to filter items by the substring specified as the `nameFilter` value. The substring can be a part of any resource parameter.\n\nTo filter items, use the following methods:\n\n -  In the `nameFilter` parameter, specify a full string that must match one of the item parameters.\n -  In the `nameFilter` parameter, specify a substring that one of the item parameters must contain. To do this, use the asterisk `*` character at the beginning of the `nameFilter` value, at the end or both.\n\nFor example, to return a list of sessions that contain the Working substring in any of their parameters, send the following request:\n\n```sh\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions?nameFilter=*Working*\n```\n\n\n### Other Filter Parameters\n\nSome resource properties of Veeam Backup & Replication REST API schemas can be used as filter query parameters.\n\nFor example, to return a list of job sessions, specify the *Job* value of the `typeFilter` parameter in the following request:\n\n```sh\nGET https://enterprise01.tech.local:9419/api/v1/sessions?typeFilter=Job\n```\n\n\n# Evaluation with Swagger UI\n\nTo start working with the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API, you can use any client application that supports the HTTPS protocol. In addition, the REST API is available through [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), a web-based tool that you can use to evaluate and explore the REST API capabilities. Swagger UI visually represents the API specification file and enables you to interact with API endpoints directly from the browser.\n\nThe Veeam Backup & Replication REST API is defined in the `swagger.json` file. You can find the file in the Veeam Backup & Replication installation folder.\n\nTo access the REST API Swagger UI, use a web browser:\n\n 1. Navigate to the following URL:\n\n    ```yml\n    https://<hostname>:<port>/swagger/index.html\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    -  `<hostname>` is a public IPv4 address or DNS hostname of the machine where Veeam Backup & Replication is installed.\n    -  `<port>` is the REST API port number set during Veeam Backup & Replication installation.\n\n       The default port is 9419.\n\n 2. From the **Select a definition** list, select the REST API version you need.\n\n <img src=\"https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/images/swagger.png\" alt=\"Evaluation with Swagger UI\" />\n\n\n## Authorization with Swagger UI\n\nVeeam Backup & Replication REST API authorization with the Swagger UI involves the following procedures:\n\n 1. Obtain an access token and a refresh token:\n\n    1. On the **Veeam Backup & Replication REST API** page, expand the **Login** section and click **POST api/oauth2/token**.\n    2. In the expanded method window, click **Try it out**.\n    3. From the **grant_type** drop-down list, select *password*.\n    4. In the **username** and **password** fields, specify the credentials of a user created in Veeam Backup & Replication.\n    5. Click **Execute**.\n\n       <img src=\"https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/images/get_token_credentials.png\" alt=\"Getting Access Token - Enter Credentials\" />\n\n       Wait for the response from the server. A successfully completed operation returns the *200* response code. In the response body, Veeam Backup & Replication returns an access token, its expiration time and a refresh token.\n\n       <img src=\"https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/images/get_token_response.png\" alt=\"Getting Access Token — Server Response\" />\n\n    6. Save the access and refresh tokens locally for further use.\n\n       <div class=\"tip\"><strong>TIP</strong><br>\n \n       You can download a server response in the JSON format. To do that, in the expanded method window, click **Download** at the lower right corner of the **Response body** field.</div>\n\n 2. Authorize your access in the Swagger UI:\n\n    1. At the top right corner of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API page, click **Authorize**.\n    2. In the **Available authorizations** window, insert the access token saved locally in the **Value** field.\n        -  If you use revision 1.2-rev1 or later, provide only the token itself.\n        -  For all earlier revisions, use the `Bearer <access_token>` format.\n\n    3. Click **Authorize**.\n\n       <img src=\"https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbr/13/rest/images/available_authorizations.png\" alt=\"Available Authorizations\" />\n\n 3.

      "description": "This section contains quick start guides on how to perform complex scenarios with Veeam Backup & Replication REST API.\n\n\n# Mass Deployment\n\nYou can perform mass deployment of your backup infrastructure by using the [Automation](Automation#operation) section of the REST API. The section includes methods that allow you to import and export resources in the JSON format. For example, you can use these methods to set up your backup infrastructure from a JSON specification or to migrate your infrastructure from one backup server to another.\n\nThe [Automation](Automation#operation) section includes dedicated methods for individual resources, so you can export and import resources granularly.\n\n\n## Exporting Resources\n\nExported resources do not include IDs. All credentials are exported with empty passwords, passphrases and private keys. Before you export resources that contain sensitive data, you can mark them by using tag parameters.\n\n\n## Importing Resources\n\nAs soon as you can import an entire collection of resources with one HTTP request, you may need to check the progress of the import operation. In response to your request, you receive a session. Within this session, Veeam Backup & Replication adds the specified objects to the backup infrastructure. To check the import progress, you can track the session state. For more information, see [Tracking Import Operation](SectionHowTo#section/Mass-Deployment/Tracking-Import-Operation).\n\nTo set up backup infrastructure using the automation methods, you must import resources in the following order:\n\n 1. Credentials and encryption passwords\n 2. Managed servers\n 3. Backup repositories\n 4. Backup proxies\n 5. Backup jobs\n\n\n## Example\n\nIn this example, you will migrate the backup infrastructure from one backup server to another. You have a backup server *backupserver01* on which a VMware vSphere infrastructure is deployed. It includes managed Microsoft Windows and Linux servers, backup repositories and backup proxies, and configured backup jobs. You need to migrate the infrastructure to another backup server *backupserver02*.\n\nTo migrate backup infrastructure from *backupserver01* to *backupserver02*, take the following steps:\n\n1. To log in to *backupserver01* and *backupserver02*, send the HTTP POST requests to the `/api/oauth2/token` paths. In response, you receive access and refresh tokens.  \nFor more information, see [Requesting Authorization](SectionOverview#section/Authorization-and-Security/Requesting-Authorization).\n\n2. Export credentials records from *backupserver01* with the [Export Credentials](Automation#operation/ExportCredentials) request.  \nIn response, you receive an array of credential records. Each record contains empty values of sensitive parameters: passwords, passphrases and private keys.\n\n3. Import the credentials to *backupserver02* with the [Import Credentials](Automation#operation/ImportCredentials) request. In the request body, specify the imported credentials. Manually fill in passwords, passphrases and private keys.\n\n4. Export servers managed by *backupserver01* with the [Export Servers](Automation#operation/ExportManagedServers) request.  \nIn response, you receive an array of servers. The array does not include *backupserver01* itself — the server where Veeam Backup & Replication is installed.\n\n5. Import managed servers to *backupserver02* with the [Import Servers](Automation#operation/ImportManagedServers) request. In the request body, specify the array of servers exported from *backupserver01*.  \nIn response, you receive an automation session. Within the session, the specified servers are added to the *backupserver02* infrastructure. For more information on tracking the session state, see [Tracking Import Operation](SectionHowTo#section/Mass-Deployment/Tracking-Import-Operation).\n\n6. Export backup repositories from *backupserver01* with the [Export Repositories](Automation#operation/ExportRepositories) request. In response, you receive an array of backup repositories.\n\n7. Import backup repositories to *backupserver02* with the [Import Repositories](Automation#operation/ImportRepositories) request. In the request body, specify the repositories exported from *backupserver01*.  \nIn response, you receive an automation session. Within the session, the specified backup repositories are added to the *backupserver02* infrastructure. For more information on tracking the session state, see [Tracking Import Operation](SectionHowTo#section/Mass-Deployment/Tracking-Import-Operation).\n\n 8. If you use backup proxies and encryption keys in your backup jobs, migrate them similarly.\n\n 9. Export backup jobs from *backupserver01* with the [Export Jobs](Automation#operation/ExportJobs) request. In response, you receive an array of jobs.  \n\n 10. Import backup jobs to *backupserver02* with the [Import Jobs](Automation#operation/ImportJobs) request. In the request body, specify the jobs imported from *backupserver01*.  \nIn response, you receive an automation session. Within the session, the specified backup jobs are created on *backupserver02*. For more information on tracking the session state, see [Tracking Import Operation](SectionHowTo#section/Mass-Deployment/Tracking-Import-Operation).\n\n\n## Tracking Import Operation\n\nWhen you perform an import operation, you send the POST HTTP request. In response, you receive a session of the Automation type. Within this session, Veeam Backup & Replication adds new objects (for example, credentials, managed servers or backup jobs) to the infrastructure of the backup server. To check the import progress, track the session state. If the import fails, you can view debug logs for detailed information on each object.\n\nFor example, you import credentials records. In response, you receive an automation session. To track the session state, run the [Get Automation Session](Automation#operation/GetAutomationSession) request.\n\nIf some credential records are not imported, you can view debug logs for detailed information on each record. To do this, send the [Get Automation Session](Automation#operation/GetAutomationSessionLogs) request.\n\n\n# Object Storage Repositories\n\nWith Veeam Backup & Replication REST API, you can add the following types of object storage repositories:\n\n -  Microsoft Azure Blob storage, Microsoft Azure Archive storage, and Microsoft Azure Data Box storage\n -  Amazon S3 storage, Amazon S3 Glacier storage, and AWS Snowball Edge storage\n -  Google Cloud storage\n -  S3 compatible storage\n -  IBM Cloud storage\n -  Wasabi Cloud storage\n -  Veeam Data Cloud Vault (revision 1.3-rev0 and later)\n\nTo add an object storage repository, take the following steps:\n\n 1. Add a cloud credentials record required for connection to the object storage repository. For details, see [Add Cloud Credentials Record](Credentials#operation/CreateCloudCreds).  \n In response, you receive a model of the created cloud credential record with its ID. Save the ID, you will require it later.  \n 2. Choose a location (cloud container and folder) that you want to map to a new object storage repository. Save folder names and container names.  \n     -  To browse existing folders, send the [Get Cloud Hierarchy](Cloud-Browser#operation/BrowseCloudEntity) request.  \n     -  To create a new folder, send the [Create New Cloud Storage Folder](Cloud-Browser#operation/CreateNewCloudFolder) request. Note Veeam Backup & Replication REST API does not create new containers, you can create a folder inside an existing container only.  \n 3. Add a new object storage repository with the [Add Repository](Repositories#operation/CreateRepository) requests.  \n    In the request body among other parameters, specify the following parameters obtained in the previous steps:  \n     -  Cloud credentials required to connect to the object storage repository.  \n     -  Cloud location you want to map to the object storage repository.\n\n\n# Microsoft Hyper-V Support\nThe REST API allows you to back up and restore Microsoft Hyper-V data.\n\n## Adding Microsoft Hyper-V Infrastructure\nBefore you can create a Microsoft Hyper-V backup job, you must configure the Microsoft Hyper-V infrastructure.\n\n### Adding Microsoft Hyper-V Servers\nYou can add the following types of Microsoft Hyper-V servers:\n\n| Type                  | Description                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| `HvServer`            | Microsoft Hyper-V standalone server  |\n| `HvCluster`           | Microsoft Hyper-V cluster            |\n| `SCVMM`               | Microsoft SCVMM server               |\n| `SmbV3StandaloneHost` | Microsoft SMB3 standalone server     |\n| `SmbV3Cluster`        | Microsoft SMB3 cluster               |\n\nTo add a Microsoft Hyper-V server, use the [Add Server](Managed-Servers#operation/CreateManagedServer) request. In the request body, specify the `HvServer` server type and other server properties.\n\nTo add a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster and include only specific Microsoft Hyper-V hosts, follow these steps:  \n1. Add the credentials to connect to the Microsoft Hyper-V cluster: [Add Credentials Record](Credentials#operation/CreateCreds). You will need to specify the credentials ID in the following requests.  \n2. Discover the hosts managed by the cluster: [Get Microsoft Hyper-V Servers Managed by Microsoft Hyper-V Cluster or SCVMM Server](Managed-Servers#operation/ResolveHyperVHosts).  \n3. Add the Microsoft Hyper-V cluster using the [Add Server](Managed-Servers#operation/CreateManagedServer) request. In the request body, specify the necessary hosts.\n\nTo add an SCVMM server and include only specific Microsoft Hyper-V hosts, follow these steps:  \n1. Add the credentials to connect to the SCVMM server: [Add Credentials Record](Credentials#operation/CreateCreds). You will need to specify the credentials ID in the following requests.\n2. To add an SCVMM server without hosts, use the [Add Server](Managed-Servers#operation/CreateManagedServer) request, setting `addAllServers` to `false` in the request body.  \n3. Discover the hosts managed by the SCVMM server: [Get Microsoft Hyper-V Servers Managed by Microsoft Hyper-V Cluster or SCVMM Server](Managed-Servers#operation/ResolveHyperVHosts).\n4. To add the necessary hosts, edit the SCVMM server: [Edit Server](Managed-Servers#operation/UpdateManagedServer).\n\n\n### Adding Off-Host Backup Proxies\n\nYou can deploy an off-host backup proxy to remove unwanted overhead on the production Microsoft Hyper-V host. To add an off-host backup proxy, use the [Add Proxy](Proxies#operation/CreateProxy) request. In the request body, specify the `HvProxy` proxy type and other proxy properties.\n\n## Creating Backup Jobs\n\nTo create a backup job, use the [Create Job](Jobs#operation/CreateJob) request. In the request body, specify the `HyperVBackup` backup job type. Note that replication jobs of Microsoft Hyper-V data are not supported.\n\n\n## Recovering Microsoft Hyper-V Data\n\nYou can perform the following recovery operations for Microsoft Hyper-V data:\n\n -  Entire VM restore\n -  Instant Recovery to Microsoft Hyper-V\n -  File restore\n\n# Microsoft Entra ID Support\n\nThe REST API allows you to back up and restore entire Microsoft Entra ID items (users, groups, administrative units, applications and roles) and item properties, as well as audit and sign-in logs.\n\n\n## Adding Microsoft Entra ID Tenant\n\nBefore you can back up Microsoft Entra ID data, you must add a Microsoft Entra ID tenant to your backup infrastructure. When adding a Microsoft Entra ID tenant, you must specify an existing Microsoft Entra ID app registration or let Veeam Backup & Replication create a new one.  \nIf you choose to create a new app registration, you must generate a verification code and register the new application before you start adding a tenant:  \n 1. To generate a code, use the [Get Microsoft Entra ID Verification Code](Credentials#operation/RequestAppRegistrationByDeviceCode) request.  \n 2. To register the new application, use the [Register Microsoft Entra ID Application](Credentials#operation/FinishAppRegistrationByDeviceCode) request.  \nTo add a tenant, use the [Add Microsoft Entra ID Tenant](Inventory-Browser#operation/CreateEntraIDTenant) request.\n\n## Creating Backup Jobs\n\nYou can create the following types of backup jobs:\n\n| Backup Job Type         |Description                                        |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `EntraIDTenantBackup`   | Microsoft Entra ID tenant backup job, which backs up tenant items such as users, groups, administrative units, applications and roles. |\n| `EntraIDAuditLogBackup` | Microsoft Entra ID audit log backup job, which backs up Microsoft Entra ID audit and sign-in logs.                              |\n\nTo create a backup job, use the [Create Job](Jobs#operation/CreateJob) request. In the request body, specify a job type and other job settings.  \nTo enable backup of Conditional Access policies, add the following registry key:\n\n```sh\nNew-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:SOFTWARE\\Veeam\\Veeam Backup and Replication\" -Name \"EntraIdBackupSupportsConditionalAccessPolicyRestore\" -Value \"1\" -PropertyType DWORD -Force\n```\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the Microsoft Entra application used for tenant backup and restore has the required permissions. For details, see the [Considerations and Limitations](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/entraid/entra_id_limitations.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.\n\n\n## Restoring Microsoft Entra ID Items and Logs\n\n\n### Restoring Microsoft Entra ID Items and Item Properties\n\nTo restore entire Microsoft Entra ID items or item properties, take the following steps:  \n 1. To get a backup ID of the Microsoft Entra ID tenant backup that you want to use for restore, send the [Get All Backups](Backups#operation/GetAllBackups) request.  \n 2. To start a mount session and mount the tenant backup to the mount point, use the [Mount Microsoft Entra ID Tenant](Restore#operation/StartEntraIDTenantRestore) request. In response, you receive a mount session ID that you will need later. You can also get existing mount sessions using the [Get Mount Points for All Microsoft Entra ID Tenants](Backup-Browsers#operation/GetAllEntraIdTenantBrowseSessions) request.  \n 3. To browse the Microsoft Entra ID tenant backup for the items you want to restore, send the [Get Microsoft Entra ID Items](Backup-Browsers#operation/BrowseEntraIdTenantMount) request.  \n 4. Choose the restore points from which to restore your items:  \n     -  To choose a restore point from the list of all tenant restore points, send the [Get Restore Points of Microsoft Entra ID Tenant](Backup-Browsers#operation/BrowseEntraIdTenantBackupRestorePoints) request.  \n     -  To check if the selected restore point contains all the items you want to restore, send the [Validate Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Items](Backup-Browsers#operation/ValidateEntraIdTenantItems) request. In the response body, you receive an array of missing items in the restore point. To browse restore points available for each missing item, use the [Get Restore Points of Microsoft Entra ID Item](Backup-Browsers#operation/BrowseEntraIdTenantRestorePoints) request.  \n     -  If you want to check if there are any differences between two restore points for a specific item, you can run either a synchronous or an asynchronous request:  \n         -  When you send a synchronous request, the client will stop execution until the comparison results are ready. For details, see [Compare Microsoft Entra ID Item Properties](Backup-Browsers#operation/CompareEntraIdTenantItem).  \n         -  When you send an asynchronous request, you receive a comparison session immediately so the client can continue execution, and you can process the comparison results later when the session changes its state to *Success*. For details, see [Start Comparing Microsoft Entra ID Item Properties](Backup-Browsers#operation/StartCompareEntraIdTenantItem) and [Get Comparison Results for Microsoft Entra ID Items](Backup-Browsers#operation/GetCompareEntraIdTenantItemResult).  \n         -  To compare Conditional Access policies, use the [Start Comparing Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access Policy](Backup-Browsers#operation/StartRecursiveComparisonEntraIdTenantItem) asynchronous requests. To get the comparison results, run the [Get Comparison Results for Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access Policy](Backup-Browsers#operation/StartRecursiveComparisonEntraIdTenantItem) request.  \n 5. If you want to check if a backed-up item exists in the production environment, send the [Check Microsoft Entra ID Items in Production](Backup-Browsers#operation/CheckEntraIdTenantProductionItems) request.  \n 6. If you restore users, send the [Generate Microsoft Entra ID User Passwords](Backup-Browsers#operation/GenerateEntraIdTenantPassword) request to generate custom passwords for restored Microsoft Entra ID users. Alternatively, you can specify one default password for all restored users.  \n 7. [Delegated restore] If you perform the restore operation under the Restore Operator role, you must obtain credentials to connect to the production Microsoft Entra ID tenant:  \n     a. Obtain a user code. For details, see [Get User Code for Delegated Restore of Microsoft Entra ID Items](Restore#operation/GetEntraIdTenantRestoreDeviceCode).  \n     b. To get the credentials required for restore, send the [Get Credentials for Delegated Restore of Microsoft Entra ID Items](Restore#operation/GetEntraIdTenantRestoreDeviceCodeState) request. Use the obtained credentials ID in the request body of the restore requests.  \n 8. To restore Microsoft Entra ID items, send the [Restore Microsoft Entra ID Items](Backup-Browsers#operation/RestoreEntraIdTenantItems) request. The request starts a restore session.  \n 9. To restore item properties, send the [Restore Microsoft Entra ID Item Properties](Backup-Browsers#operation/RestoreEntraIdTenantItemAttributes) request.  \n 10. To stop restore sessions, send the [Stop Restore Session of Microsoft Entra ID Tenant](Backup-Browsers#operation/StopEntraIdTenantItemRestoreSession) request.  \n 11. To stop the mount session and unmount the tenant backup from the mount point, send the [Unmount Microsoft Entra ID Tenant](Restore#operation/StopEntraIDTenantRestore) request.\n\n\n### Restoring Microsoft Entra ID Audit Logs\n\nTo restore Microsoft Entra ID audit and sign-in logs, take the following steps:\n\n 1. To get the ID of the Microsoft Entra ID log backup you want to use for restore, run the [Get All Backups](Backups#operation/GetAllBackups) request.  \n 2. To start a mount session and mount log files to the mount point, use the [Start Microsoft Entra ID Audit Log Restore](Restore#operation/StartEntraIDAuditLogMount) request. In response, you receive a mount session ID that you will need later. You can also get existing mount sessions using the [Get All File Restore Mount Points](Backup-Browsers#operation/GetAllFlrBrowseSessions) request.  \n 3. To browse the hierarchy tree of the mounted log files, use the [Compare Files and Folders](Backup-Browsers#operation/WindowsFlrBrowseCompareToProduction) request. If you specify an empty path in the request body, you will browse the root folder, and then you can go deeper into the tree.  \n 4. If you want to search for a specific file or folder, use the [Search for Files and Folders](Backup-Browsers#operation/FlrStartSearchFor) and [Browse Search Results](Backup-Browsers#operation/FlrBrowseSearchResult) requests.  \n 5. To restore log files, send the [Copy Files and Folders to Specific Folder](Backup-Browsers#operation/UnstructuredDataFlrCopyTo) request.  \n 6. To stop the mount session and unmount the log files from the mount point, send the [Unmount Microsoft Entra ID Audit Logs](Restore#operation/StopEntraIDAuditLogMount) request.\n\n# Unstructured Data Support\n\nThe REST API allows you to back up and restore unstructured data.\n\n## Adding Unstructured Data Infrastructure\nBefore you can create an unstructured data backup job, you must configure the infrastructure.\n\n### Adding Unstructured Data Sources\nYou can add the following types of unstructured data sources:\n\n| Type              | Description                                            |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `FileServer`      | Microsoft Windows-managed or Linux-managed file server |\n| `SMBShare`        | SMB file share                                         |\n| `NFSShare`        | NFS file share                                         |\n| `NASFiler`        | Enterprise NAS system as a NAS filer                   |\n| `S3Compatible`    | S3 Compatible Object Storage                           |\n| `AmazonS3`        | Amazon S3 Object Storage                               |\n| `AzureBlob`       | Microsoft Azure Object Storage                         |\n\n1. Get the necessary credentials record to connect to the file share or object storage. The type of credentials required depends on the unstructured data source:\n    - For file shares, run the [Get All Credentials](Credentials#operation/GetAllCreds) or the [Add Credentials Record](Credentials#operation/CreateCreds) request. Note that credentials may not be required for SMB shares and NAS filers.\n    - For object storage, run the [Get All Cloud Credentials](Credentials#operation/GetAllCloudCreds) or the [Add Cloud Credentials Record](Credentials#operation/CreateCloudCreds) request.\n2. [For object storage] Run the [Get Cloud Hierarchy](Cloud-Browser#operation/BrowseCloudEntity) request to browse the object storage and get the remaining required properties.\n3. All unstructured data types require a cache repository. Run the [Get All Repositories](Repositories#operation/GetAllRepositories) or the [Add Repository](Repositories#operation/CreateRepository) request.\n4. Run the [Add Unstructured Data Servers](Inventory-Browser#operation/CreateUnstructuredDataServer) request to add an unstructured data source to the backup server. Additional requests may be required depending on the type of unstructured data source.\n    - [For file servers] The server must be added as a managed server. To get the necessary property values, run the [Get All Servers](Managed-Servers#operation/GetAllManagedServers) or the [Add Server](Managed-Servers#operation/CreateManagedServer) request.\n    - [For NAS filers] The server must be added as a backup repository to the storage infrastructure. To get the necessary property values, run the [Get All Repositories](Repositories#operation/GetAllRepositories) or the [Add Repository](Repositories#operation/CreateRepository) request.\n5. You can use the following requests to get, edit and remove unstructured data servers:\n   - [Get Unstructured Data Servers](Inventory-Browser#operation/GetAllUnstructuredDataServers)\n   - [Get Unstructured Data Server](Inventory-Browser#operation/GetUnstructuredDataServer)\n   - [Edit Unstructured Data Server](Inventory-Browser#operation/UpdateUnstructuredDataServers)\n   - [Remove Unstructured Data Server](Inventory-Browser#operation/DeleteUnstructuredDataServers)\n\n## [Optional] Adding Backup Proxies\n\nYou can deploy a backup proxy to remove unwanted overhead on the server. All unstructured data types require proxies, except for file servers. However, note that all unstructured data types that require a backup proxy allow you to auto-select backup proxies when creating a backup job, which removes the need to set one up manually.  \nTo add a backup proxy, use the [Add Proxy](Proxies#operation/CreateProxy) request. In the request body, specify the `GeneralPurposeProxy` proxy type and other proxy properties.\n\n## Creating Backup Jobs\nThe REST API allows you to create the following types of unstructured data backup jobs:\n\n| Backup Job Type       | Description                    |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| `FileBackup`          | File share backup jobs.        |\n| `ObjectStorageBackup `| Object storage backup jobs.    |\n\nTo create the backup job, run the following requests:  \n1. Run the [Add Repository](Repositories#operation/CreateRepository) request to get the IDs of the backup repositories that will serve as a primary and archive repository for the backup job.\n2. Run the [Get All Backups](Backups#operation/GetAllBackups) request to get the source backup ID. This allows you to map the job to a specific backup stored in the backup repository. Backup job mapping allows you to move backup files to a new backup repository and to point the job to existing backups on this new backup repository.\n3. Run the [Get All Unstructured Data Servers](Inventory-Browser#operation/GetAllUnstructuredDataServers) request to get the ID of the unstructured data server you need.\n4. Run the [Create Job](Jobs#operation/CreateJob) request to start the backup job. In the request body, specify the `FileBackup` or `ObjectStorageBackup` backup job type.\n5. [Optional] You can use the [Run Health Check and Repair](Backups#operation/StartHealthCheckBackup) request on the backup job or the backup itself to check the integrity of the backup job or the backup.\n\n## Restoring Unstructured Data\nThe REST API allows you to perform the following restore operations:\n- [Restore an entire file share](SectionHowTo#section/Unstructured-Data-Support/Restoring-Unstructured-Data/Restoring-Entire-File-Share)\n- [Restore an entire bucket or container](SectionHowTo#section/Unstructured-Data-Support/Restoring-Unstructured-Data/Restoring-Entire-Bucket-or-Container)\n- [Perform Instant File Share Recovery](SectionHowTo#section/Unstructured-Data-Support/Restoring-Unstructured-Data/Performing-Instant-File-Share-Recovery)\n- [Restore files from unstructured data backup](SectionHowTo#section/Unstructured-Data-Support/Restoring-Unstructured-Data/Restoring-Files-from-Unstructured-Data-Backup)\n\n### Restoring Entire File Share\n\nTo restore the entire file share, run the following requests:  \n1. Run the [Get All Restore Points](Restore-Points#operation/GetAllObjectRestorePoints) request to get the ID of the restore point as of which you want to restore your data.  \n2. Run the [Get All Unstructured Data Servers](Inventory-Browser#operation/GetAllUnstructuredDataServers) request to get the ID of the target file share.  \nThis ID is not necessary if `restoreToBackupServer` property value is set to `true` — in this case, the file share will be restored to the backup server.\n3. Enter the remaining properties in the request body and run the [Restore Entire File Share](Restore#operation/EntireUnstructuredDataShareRestore) request.\n\n### Restoring Entire Bucket or Container\n\nTo restore the entire object storage bucket or container, run the following requests:  \n1. Run the [Get All Restore Points](Restore-Points#operation/GetAllObjectRestorePoints) request to get the ID of the restore point as of which you want to restore your data.\n2. Run the [Get All Unstructured Data Servers](Inventory-Browser#operation/GetAllUnstructuredDataServers) request to get the ID of the target object storage.  \nThis ID is not necessary if `restoreToBackupServer` property value is set to `true` — in this case, the bucket or container will be restored to the backup server.\n3. Enter the remaining properties in the request body and run the [Restore Entire Bucket or Container](Restore#operation/EntireUnstructuredDataOSRestore) request.\n\n### Performing Instant File Share Recovery\nYou can perform Instant File Share Recovery to the original or another location. This operation is only available for SMB shares.\n\n#### Starting Instant File Share Recovery\nTo start Instant File Share Recovery, perform the following steps:\n1. Run the [Get All Restore Points](Restore-Points#operation/GetAllObjectRestorePoints) request to get the `restorePointId` property value of the SMB share you want to restore.\n2. [Optional] Run the [Get Mount Servers](Mount-Servers#operation/GetAllMountServers) request to get the `mountServerId` property value. This property is not required if you have set the `autoSelectMountServers` property to `true` — in this case, the backup server is used as a mount server.\n3. Run the [Start Instant File Share Recovery](Restore#operation/InstantUnstructuredDataRecoveryMount) request using the responses of the previous requests in the request body.
